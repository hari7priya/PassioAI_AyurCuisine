    Freshly made lassi rekindles agni, the digestive fire. It is a natural
    remedy to prevent stomach problems, like constipation and bloating. Its high
    calcium content also makes it excellent in improving bone and dental health.
    Lassi is a great source of lactic acid and vitamin D that boosts the immune
    system.

    Ayurveda knows probiotics in the form of so-called “Asavas” and “Arishtas”.
    The simplest and one of the best ayurvedic probiotics, however, is lassi,
    also known as takra. It cleanses the gut and promotes digestion. When
    prepared according to ayurvedic rules, this drink, which is popular and
    widespread throughout India, contains valuable microorganisms that gently
    support our digestion and promote digestive strength. It is also very easy
    to make at home and is suitable for all dosha types. It is therefore well
    worth drinking lassi on a regular basis. Lassi is particularly recommended
    for people who frequently feel bloated or suffer from constipation, or who
    feel unpleasantly full after a meal. People with a poor appetite and weak
    digestive fire should definitely also try lassi.
