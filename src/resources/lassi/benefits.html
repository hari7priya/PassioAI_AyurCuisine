      Freshly made lassi rekindles agni, the digestive fire. It is a natural
      remedy to prevent stomach problems, like constipation and bloating. Its
      high calcium content also makes it excellent in improving bone and dental
      health. Lassi is a great source of lactic acid and vitamin D that boosts
      the immune system.

      Ayurveda knows probiotics in the form of so-called “Asavas” and
      “Arishtas”. The simplest and one of the best ayurvedic probiotics,
      however, is lassi, also known as takra. It cleanses the gut and promotes
      digestion. When prepared according to ayurvedic rules, this drink, which
      is popular and widespread throughout India, contains valuable
      microorganisms that gently support our digestion and promote digestive
      strength. It is also very easy to make at home and is suitable for all
      dosha types. It is therefore well worth drinking lassi on a regular basis.
      Lassi is particularly recommended for people who frequently feel bloated
      or suffer from constipation, or who feel unpleasantly full after a meal.
      People with a poor appetite and weak digestive fire should definitely also
      try lassi.
