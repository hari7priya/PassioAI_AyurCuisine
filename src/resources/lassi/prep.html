    Lassi is made with yogurt and can either be sweet or salty! It's the perfect
    drink to cool on a hot summer day! Jump to Recipe If you are looking for a
    cooling summer drink, then look no further than a glass of Lassi. Most
    popular in northers parts of India, lassi is a yogurt drink which can either
    be sweet or salty. There are so many ways to flavor it, but for me nothing
    beats the classic!

<li><strong>Yogurt</strong>: Highly recommend using full-fat yogurt to get a rich, thick and creamy texture. But considering fat intake, you can use low-fat or fat-free yogurt.</li>



<li><strong>Black salt (kala namak)</strong>: It adds a nice zing and flavor to the drink.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Roasted cumin powder:</strong> hereâ€™s how to make it at home - Dry roast the cumin seeds on medium-low heat with stirring constantly until aromatic and dark in color. Once cools down grind into a powder using a spice grinder (or mortar and pestle if making a small quantity). You can keep this in the air-tight container for up to 2-3 months.</li>
