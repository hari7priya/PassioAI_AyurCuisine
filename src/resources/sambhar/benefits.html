    Sambar is a South Indian stew made with lentils, mixed vegetables, tamarind,
    herbs, spices & a special aromatic spice powder known as sambar powder. This
    spice powder is the key to make a good sambar. A variety of spices & lentils
    are used to make this powder. Most traditional homes make their own sambhar
    masala powder to suit their taste buds.

    The Historical Dictionary of Indian Food' by Late Food Historian KT Achaya
    describes Sambar as, "a fairly thick spicy extract of thuvar dhal soured
    with tamarind, frequently containing soft vegetables like brinjal,
    drumstick, gourd and lady's finger."

    This is largely sattvic, but if pungent spices, tamarind and salt are
    overdone, can be rajasic in nature. The sattvic nature increases if moong
    dhal is used since moong dhal is easier than toor dhal to digest. If you
    store the sambhar and reuse/reheat after refrigerating, the tamasic quality
    will start to increase as the prana/life force in the food goes down.
