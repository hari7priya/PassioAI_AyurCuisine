      Sambar is a South Indian stew made with lentils, mixed vegetables,
      tamarind, herbs, spices & a special aromatic spice powder known as sambar
      powder. This spice powder is the key to make a good sambar. A variety of
      spices & lentils are used to make this powder. Most traditional homes make
      their own sambhar masala powder to suit their taste buds.

      The Historical Dictionary of Indian Food' by Late Food Historian KT Achaya
      describes Sambar as, "a fairly thick spicy extract of thuvar dhal soured
      with tamarind, frequently containing soft vegetables like brinjal,
      drumstick, gourd and lady's finger."

      This is largely sattvic, but if pungent spices, tamarind and salt are
      overdone, can be rajasic in nature. The sattvic nature increases if moong
      dhal is used since moong dhal is easier than toor dhal to digest. If you
      store the sambhar and reuse/reheat after refrigerating, the tamasic
      quality will start to increase as the prana/life force in the food goes
      down.
