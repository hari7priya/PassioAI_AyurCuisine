      <strong>Yogurt</strong>: Highly recommend using full-fat yogurt to get a
      rich, thick and creamy texture. But considering fat intake, you can use
      low-fat or fat-free yogurt.

      <strong>Roasted cumin powder:</strong> hereâ€™s how to make it at home - Dry
      roast the cumin seeds on medium-low heat with stirring constantly until
      aromatic and dark in color. Once cools down grind into a powder using a
      spice grinder (or mortar and pestle if making a small quantity). You can
      keep this in the air-tight container for up to 2-3 months.
