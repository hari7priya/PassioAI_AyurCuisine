    The recipe involves only three steps â€“ soaking lentils, grinding them to
    make fluffy batter and lastly shaping small portions of the batter &amp;
    frying. Traditionally medu vada batter is ground in a manual stone grinder
    but a lot of us also grind it in an electric mixer grinder/ blender or a wet
    grinder.

    Making fluffy batter is the key to crisp and fluffy vadas. So you need a
    good strong and powerful blender that can grind your lentils really well to
    a fluffy texture. If you use a regular low watt grinder you may end up with
    hard and dense vadas and even more your blender may break down.
